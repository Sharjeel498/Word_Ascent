# Word_Ascent

Word_Ascent is a small Python-based application that I built to improve my vocabulary by adding and guessing word meaning pairs. The app has a simple user-interface built with Tkinter.

* #### Add Words:
   1- Click the Add button. <br>
   2- Use the interface to type a word and its meaning, then click "Add" or press Enter. <br>
   3- To add multiple meanings for a word, click "+" after adding a meaning, then add another meaning.
* #### Test Vocabulary:
   1- Click the Test button. <br>
   2- Answer the correct synonym or meaning of the given word, then click "Check" or press Enter. <br>
   3- If a word is answered correctly, the word is moved to a higher level. <br>
   4- If the word is in level_5 it is moved to archive. <br>
   5- If answered incorrectly, the word is moved a lower level. <br>
